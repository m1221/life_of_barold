## AUTHOR NOTES
This is a simple text-based math game. It asks the user to solve math problems. If the user answers the question correctly, he is rewarded with money and happiness. If the user answers the question incorrectly then his happiness is penalized, but he still gets some money.

This game is mostly a learning exercise for myself. I wanted to learn a little bit about classes, importing modules, and making a simple text-based game.

This is an alpha version. It's not a finished product. Content and extra functionality are lacking. Documentation/content is sorely lacking. The code is not optimized nor does it represent good style.
